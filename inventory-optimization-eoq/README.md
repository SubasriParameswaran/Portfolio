# Inventory Optimization â€” EOQ + Reorder Point

Small but mighty: demonstrate supply chain math with **clean code** and tests.

- EOQ: minimize annual ordering + holding cost
- ROP: meet service level with lead-time uncertainty

## How to run
```bash
python eoq.py
```

## Extend ideas
- Add backorder cost and optimize service level.
- Compare continuous vs periodic review.
