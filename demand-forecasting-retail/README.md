# Retail Demand Forecasting

Flagship end-to-end project. Replace this text using the template in `../../templates/PROJECT_README.md`.

**Idea**: Forecast daily SKU-store sales. Compare baselines (Naïve/Moving Avg) vs ML (Tree-based) and quantify impact on stockouts and holding costs.

**Data**: Use a public retail dataset (e.g., a Kaggle daily sales dataset) or generate synthetic data. Keep real data out of git. Place raw files under `data/raw/` (gitignored).

**Demo**: A Streamlit app (`app.py`) that loads a trained model and lets a user try “what-if” feature changes.
